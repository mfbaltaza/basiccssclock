Very simple and kind of cute CSS Clock.

This it's a part of a Javascript journey that I'm going one, I'm pushing this here and need to fix a glitch with the seconds hand every time that a minute finish because it kind of glitch. This code was built thanks to Javascript30 Wes Bos Course which it's the challenge I'm taking right now:)

btw; // I kind of lost the original file, so I think I uploaded the one that Wes Bos did, however I still did the challenge, but I would be looking for my lost file haha. And looking the fix the buggy bug that is there in the seconds hand.
